                <p>Claudio Paul Sanchez III (born March 12, 1978) is an American writer and musician of 
                    Puerto Rican and Italian descent best known for being the lead singer and guitarist for

                <p>Sanchez began producing comic books in 2000, beginning with <em>The Bag.On.Line Adventures. The Bag.On.Line Adventures</em> lasted two issues due to problems with the artist, deadlines and financial issues. Sanchez's next project was the graphic novel <em>Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness</em>. The graphic novel was released alongside the album of the same name, however Sanchez has stated that the novel was incomplete due to financial issues.</p>
